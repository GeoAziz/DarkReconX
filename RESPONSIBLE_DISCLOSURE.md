# Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security issue when using DarkReconX, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. Do not publish the issue publicly.
2. Send details to the maintainers (see `SECURITY.md`) including steps to reproduce, impact, and suggested mitigations.
3. Give maintainers time to address the issue. If you need a timeline, include it in your report.

We will credit reporters who follow this process, unless they request anonymity.
