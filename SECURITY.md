# Security Policy

Report security issues to the maintainers by opening a private issue or emailing security@yourdomain.example. Do NOT disclose vulnerabilities publicly until they are verified and a fix or mitigation is available.

We accept responsible disclosure and will acknowledge reports and follow up within a reasonable timeframe.
